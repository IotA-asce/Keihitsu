# Keihitsu

A placeholder repository for the Keihitsu project. This scaffold provides a minimal structure to start development.

## Structure
- `src/` – Source code for the project, organized as a Python package (`keihitsu`).
- `tests/` – Automated tests.
- `docs/` – Project documentation.
- `data/` – Data assets; tracked with a placeholder file to keep the directory in version control.

## Getting started
1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install project dependencies (to be defined).
3. Add application code under `src/` and tests under `tests/`.
